1)XINU :

  Advantages:
1) Simple algorithm
2) Low context switch
3) Highest priority job executed first

 Disadvantage:

1)Starvation of low priority processes
2) Non - interactive
3) Long response time


2) LINUX :

 Advantage:
1) Much better response time
2) Highest priority job executed first in epoch
3) Chances of Starvation low


Disadvantage:

1) High priority processes might have to wait before being given time to execute
2) Context switches may occur although same process is executed
3) Mimics a largest job first in most cases of dissimlar values of priority

3) Real Time:

Advantage:

1) Allows for higher priority jobs to be executed before normal processes
2) Round robin adds low response time

Disadvantages:

1) Flow maybe dependent on seed value
2) If large amount of Real time processes present normal processes may execute later
